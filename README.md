# Planit Technical Assessment

_Submission by Jed Aureus Gonzales_

### Explanation

I opted to use Webdriver.io so that I could do a clean implementation of the Page Object Model approach. For the purpose of this assessment, I tried to keep it simple and straight to the point. I prioritized correctness over completeness.

Some considerations for future improvements:

- Complete the elements for all pages, including `login.page.js`
- Optimization of helper functions
- Enums for the nav names and products
- Separation of spec files per page (for the purpose of this assessment, I just create one E2E spec file to go through the three test cases)

### Steps to run:

1. Run `npm install` on the root directory
2. Run `npm test`
